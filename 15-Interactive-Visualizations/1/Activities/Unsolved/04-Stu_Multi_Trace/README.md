# Greek vs Roman Mythology

In this activity, you will compare search results between greek mythology and roman mythology to see which god is most popular.

## Instructions

* Create a grouped bar chart to plot the popularity of each Greek and Roman god. Note: these gods have already been paired with their counterpart, so you will just need to extract the appropriate attributes from the data array.

* Use JavaScript to extract the attributes that you need for this chart from the data array listed in the file `data.js`. Note: This file has already been linked in the HTML, so you can just use the `data` variable in your `plots.js` code.

## Bonus

* Use the Greek Name and Roman Name as Hovertext for the charts.
